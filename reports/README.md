# Deployment Reports

This directory contains deployment reports generated by the deployment script.

## Report Format

Reports are stored in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-08-15T12:34:56.789Z",
  "environment": "production",
  "apiUrl": "https://resumeai-simple-backend.onrender.com/api/v1",
  "testResults": [
    {
      "name": "Test Auth Endpoint",
      "passed": true,
      "details": { ... }
    },
    ...
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Warning message 1",
    "Warning message 2"
  ],
  "exitCode": 0
}
```

## Understanding Test Results

Each test result contains:

- `name`: The name of the test
- `passed`: Whether the test passed (true) or failed (false)
- `details`: Additional information about the test result
- `error`: Error information if the test encountered an error

## Exit Codes

- `0`: All deployment checks passed successfully
- `1`: One or more deployment checks failed

## Generating Reports

Reports are automatically generated when running the deployment script:

```
node scripts/deploy.js [environment]
```

Where `environment` is one of:
- `development` (default)
- `staging`
- `production`

## Using Reports

These reports are useful for:

1. Tracking deployment history
2. Diagnosing issues in different environments
3. Verifying proper configuration of the system
4. Ensuring authentication flows are working correctly

## Cleaning Up

Old reports can be safely deleted when no longer needed.
